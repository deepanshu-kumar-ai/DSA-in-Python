## DSA-in-Python
My personal Python DSA collection â€” arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, recursion, and more. Clean, readable code with comments, showing my learning journey and problem-solving practice.

# My Python DSA Journey

Hey there ðŸ‘‹ â€” this repo is basically my notebook for learning **Data Structures and Algorithms** in Python.  
Iâ€™m solving problems, making mistakes, fixing them, and slowly getting better every day.  

## ðŸ“‚ What you'll find here
- Arrays 
- Stacks & Queues 
- Linked Lists 
- Graphs
- Sorting & Searching
- Recursion 

## ðŸ’¡ Why I made this
I wanted one place to keep all my DSA practice so I can look back and see my progress.  
Also, if future me forgets how BFS worksâ€¦ well, itâ€™s all here.
